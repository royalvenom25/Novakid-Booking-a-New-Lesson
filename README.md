# Novakid Booking a New Lesson
Test Task - [Novakid](http://novakidschool.com/)

**The Task:** <br> Design an experience that will improve the booking of the lesson with the goal displaying it effectively and invite further exploration.

**The Goal:** <br> Seamless experience that will be usable for the parents to accomplish lesson bookings & trigger further exploration.

## **My Approach**
- Reaserch as much as possible the current website to understand the flows & structure of the product.
- Ideation & hypothesis of a potential flow & analysing the possible paintpoints.
- Visualisation of the Ideas - Wireframing.
- Testing the usability with friend & collegue.
- Improvements & fixes.
- Creation of the Library / UIkit Elements & components.
- Designing high fidelity mockup & simple prototype (2 screens).
